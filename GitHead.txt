What is HEAD in Git?
	HEAD is a reference variable that always points to the tip of your current branch, that is, recent commit of your current branch.

HEAD can be used with the following symbols to refer to other commits:

Tilde symbol (~): Used to point to the previous commits from base HEAD
Caret symbol (^): Used to point to the immediate parent commit from the current referenced commit
